150g chorizo, cut into chunks
2 small avocados
1 lime, juiced, plus extra halves, to serve
handful chopped coriander
For the pancakes
75g plain flour
2 eggs
125ml cold chicken stock
1 tbsp Worcestershire or soy sauce
50g greens, shredded
1 carrot, grated
1 leek, trimmed and shredded
1 courgette, trimmed and grated
2 tbsp sunflower oil

To make the pancakes, sift the flour into a mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the eggs, stock and Worcestershire or soy sauce. Whisk the wet ingredients, gradually drawing in the flour to make a smooth batter; season well. Stir in the vegetables.
Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Using half the batter, ladle in 4 even amounts and fry until the bases are golden. Turn and cook for a further 3-4 mins until set. Remove and set aside, covered, while you repeat with the remaining oil and pancake batter.
Meanwhile, heat a separate frying pan and dry-fry the chorizo until crisp. In a bowl, roughly mash the avocado flesh with the lime juice and season.
Arrange 2 pancakes on each plate and top with the avocado and chorizo. Scatter over the coriander and serve with the extra lime halves for squeezing over.
